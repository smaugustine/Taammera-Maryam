A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

Concerning how Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, punished Nestorius, the heretic who blasphemed against her.

There are some who think that Nestorius departed from the error into which he strayed and abandoned his blasphemy, but he did not depart from his error, and by the will of the Lord he died in the manner that Herod died. This deed was uncoverd, since Saint Cyril cursed him, saying, "As your tongue blasphemed Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, let it be buried with you in the earth. Let your judges help to heal you." Immediately his mouth was struck and his tongue came out and descended to his chest from his mouth. It became like the breasts of a woman, pouring out milk and pus, and it was eaten away by worms and he died.

Truly astonishing is your endurance and silence as he, a son of perdition, blasphemed you. How were the fiery ones unable to bury him? How did the seas not rise to drown him? How was the earth silent, not reducing him? How was the lightning silent? May it tear him apart.

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.
