A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

On this day the entire Christian people celebrates the feast of Our Lady Mary, the Mother of God, on the day on which she received the Covenant of Mercy from her son, Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, for those who celebrate her memory and who call on her name and who give alms to the poor, even just some cold water.

And this holy Mary, after her son ascended to heaven, having taken on her pure flesh and sat at the right hand of His Father, having fulfilled the entire law, having become man, except that He was without sin, having accepted the suffering of the Cross of His own favour and His own will, which He did for our salvation, and after He left His mother Mary in the house of John, His disciple, whom He loved — as He entrusted her to him, saying, “Behold your son,” and said to that disciple, “Behold your mother,” and from that time on Our Lady Mary lived there — she would go to the tomb of her son, which was Golgotha, in order to pray there. And when the Jews saw her, they were filled with wrath and envy and they wished to stone her, but the Lord hid her from their eyes. Then they took council, that they might set guards over His tomb in order that she might not come again to pray there. But she did not cease from coming each night. And the guards did not see her, for the veil of the glory of her son covered her.

And at all times, angels came to her to serve her, and her son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, would visit her often and fulfill all that she desired. And the angels would take her up to heaven and show her the place of rest for the righteous, where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob dwell. And all the souls of the fathers, those who died from Adam until that time, welcomed her and bowed to her, saying, “Glory to the Lord Who created you for us, flesh of our flesh, bone of our bones. In you we have found salvation, and you have become a harbour of life from corruption through the incarnation of the Son of God from you."

And from there the angels led her and brought her to her beloved son and to His throne and they drew back the curtains of flames of fire on the right and the left. And Our Lord took her hand, kissed her mouth, and said to her, “Have you come, O my mother?” And He took her up to the throne of His glory and enthroned her with Him and told her of the joy and happiness — which no eye has seen and no ear has heard and no heart of men has considered — which He prepared for her. And beneath the throne of His glory she saw David, her father, the King of Israel, with the entire assembly of the prophets and angels and the souls of the righteous standing in a circle around her, like a wall, singing to the lyre, saying, “Listen, my daughter, and see, and make your ears attentive. Forget your people and your father’s house, for the King desired your beauty, and He is your Lord”.[^1]

And from there, the angels again led her, so that she might see the place of judgement. And they brought her to the edge of the darkness which is prepared for sinners and for Satan and his hosts and for all those who walk in his ways. And Our Lady Mary said, “Woe to me! Who will tell the sons of men, that they should not come here?” And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, O Mary: the Lord is with you and with those after you also." And then the angels carried her and brought her back to her place.

And from that time on, Our Lady Mary sat, being exceedingly sad for the sake of all sinners. And — as on this day — on the 16th of Yakkātit, she stood at the site of Calvary and pleaded with her son, saying, “O my son, I adjure You, by the Lord, Your Father, by Christ, Your Name, and by the Paraclete, Your Spirit, and by my womb, which carried You for 9 months and 5 days, though the earth is unable carry you and angels are unable to approach you. O my son, I adjure You, by Your going out from me, which was without weariness, and Your birth, which was without pain. I adjure you by my breasts, which raised You, and by my lips, which kissed You. I adjure you by my hands, which embraced You, and by my feet, which walked with You. I adjure You by the manger in which You laid, and by the rags in which You were wrapped. O my son and my beloved, I plead and beseech You, that You hear the words of my supplication and that You come to me and fulfill everything in my heart.”

And when Our Lady, the holy virgin Mary, mother of the Light, said this, Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ descended to her, with ten thousand times ten thousand and tens of thousands times tens of thousands of angels surrounding Him. And He said to her, “What shall I do for you, my mother? What do you desire, that I shall do your desire?” Our Lady Mary answered her beloved son and said to Him, “O my beloved, my son, my Lord and my Saviour, my hope and my refuge, in You I have placed my faith. I waited on You in the womb of my mother, and You covered me in the womb. You are my memory at all times. And now hear, O Lord, my prayer and my supplication, and be attentive to the words of my mouth which I speak to You: I am Your mother, Mary. I am Your handmaid. Him who celebrates my memory and who builds a church in my name, or him who clothes one who is naked, who visits one who is sick, who feeds one who is hungry, who gives drink to one who thirsts, or him who comforts one who is sorrowful and who makes glad one who is sad, or him who has written down my praise, who names his child after my name and who sings a song on my feast, reward him, O Lord, with a good reward which is from You, which no eye has seen and no ear has heard and which is not in the heart of men. I plead and I supplicate You, Lord, for the sake of all who believe in me: make them free from Sheol, recalling the hunger and thirst and all the trials that found me through You.

And Our Lord Jesus Christ replied, saying, “It will be as you have said to Me, and I will complete for you your supplication. I became incarnate from you. I swear upon myself that My covenant will not be false to you."

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

>*Salutation to thee, the book of the law and the covenant,*
>*The likeness of the stone tablets.*
>*To those who call upon thy name from any place,*
>*Compassionate of heart for sinners, compassionate of heart for the sorrowful,*
>*Compassionate of heart for the oppressed, truly Mary is.*
