A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

Saint Basil said, "When I arose in the morning, I sent a message to the painter and received from him a board and gold and jewels. Taking with me the archpriest Ira, the priest Theodore, and the deacons Felicius and Anestimos, I went to the place which my Lady showed me in the vision. I dug a little more than two cubits and found the board. Its appearance was like live coals and from top to bottom it was covered with a silk wrapping. When I saw it, I rejoiced greatly and said, 'Truly this day is the day of peace which my Lady showed me.' And when I uncovered wrapping which was around the board, I saw the face of the icon of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, its radiant beauty shining gratly. I prostrated and, after I knelt to the icon, I was blessed.

"The icon, though, was very wide. We thought, 'How will we lift this great icon?' and the board moved from its place. It went out from the hole with its wrapping atop it and I marvelled at its size. We thought, 'How will we carry it, given its width?' Having heard us, a voice came out of the board upon which was painted the icon of Our Lady, saying, 'How they neglect my carrying! Behold, my burden will be light and beautiful. For you, carrying it will not be strenuous.' When I heard this voice, I rejoiced along with the priests who were with me. We picked up the board by its sides and brought it to the church, leaving it in front of the altar before we erected the pillars of the church.

"The congregation, when they saw the board, marvelled at its greatness. The icon, though, was covered with a wrapping and they did not know that an icon was painted on the board. As the board sat, olive oil flowed out from it and filled the whole place. In that hour, all the people gathered and crowded together in order to see the miracle.

"Indeed, marvellous is the power of your aid which was granted to you by the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit such that olive oil flowed from your icon, healing the sick, purifying the impure, and driving away demons.

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.
