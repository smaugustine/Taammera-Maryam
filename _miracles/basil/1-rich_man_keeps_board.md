A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

There was a certain archbishop whose name was Basil who always would rebuke the rich. He would say to them, "Give your wealth for the sake of the name of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, as Our Lord said, 'Make friends from unjust wealth.'"[^1] 

One day, he wrote to a certain rich man who was without any good deeds. He did not write to him out of a desire for gold or luxurious clothes but rather to obtain a beautiful board on which to paint an icon of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. And the rich man said to those with him, "What is this church and who is this Mary for whom they build a church? I would prefer to keep this board so that if my children are poor after my death they may obtain much gold and silver with it. Even if I had a thousand boards like it, still I would not give any to you, not a single one. I will not do a charitable deed." And before the words were fully out of his mouth, that wicked man fell in that very hour and surrendered his soul.

When his wife and children saw what befell him, great fear came upon them. They took the board and ten pounds of gold and precious pearls and they offered them to Abba Basil. He, however, would not accept their gold, since Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, does not love those who are boastful or prideful. She makes low those who make themselves great and raises up those who humble themselves.[^2]

They saw the sign which Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, enacted upon that rich man who believed in his wealth. Before the words left his mouth, as he said, "I love my wealth," that rich man died. Glory to the Lord and to His Virgin Mother, who did not forgive that rich man who withheld that board and said, "What is this church and what is this charity?" And, having said this, that rich man died.

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.
