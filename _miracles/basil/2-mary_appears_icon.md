A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

Saint Basil said, "While I, poor Basil, was sleeping, I saw a vision and behold! I saw a woman who was shining like the sun all around and her clothes, too, shone with glittering light. With her were two virgin girls. She said to me, 'Basil, do you know who I am?' And I replied, 'O my Lady, how shall I recognize you? You who are surrounded with such glory?'

"And she said to me, 'I am the Virgin Mary for whom you have built a great church. And these are the virgins who accompany me: this is Saint Irene and the other is Saint Sophia. These are they who kept their virginity from their youths and spilled their blood for the sake of the Name of my beloved son. Now, upon that board which you received from that rich man, take care not to paint my icon upon it, for the grace of the Lord has not come down upon it, as it is written: "But let not the oil of sinners annoint my head."[^1] Instead, when you get up in the morning, go east to the entrance of the former church and dig two cubits into the earth. Take with you priests, deacons, and righteous persons. You will find a board which is red like live coal and upon which is painted my icon — which was not painted by human hands — and the likenesses of the two virgins, one to my right and the other to my left. Place it at the wall of the altar and I shall perform many wondrous and astonishing deeds through it on the day of its consecration and the completion of the church.'

"And I, poor Basil, said to her, 'O my Lady and the mother of my Lord, truly you know we desire two pillars for your sanctuary, for honour and the completion of the altar.' And she replied to me, 'Search for the board which resembles live coals and work it in the church and again I showed you the place of the pillars that they place in the sanctuary.' And having said this to me, Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God hid herself from me.

"Indeed, wondrous and amazing is the strength of your love, as you have shown me your icon."

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.
