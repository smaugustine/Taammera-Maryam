A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

Saint Basil said, "Again, as before, Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, appeared to me as I slept. She said to me, 'Why are you idle instead of seeking pillars to put above the board?' I replied to her, 'O my Lady, you know that I have gone everywhere looking for two pillars which are the size of the wall of the sanctuary but I have not found them.' And she said to me, 'If you want to erect pillars, behold the temple in the city. You will find two pillars standing by the idolatrous temple which they erected in the days of the pharaohs. Upon them are the names of demons. People tried to seize them but they were unable to move them. However, by the command of my beloved son, they will come.' Having said this, Our Lady hid herself from me.

"Awaking from the vision, I thought to myself, 'How shall I take those great pillars?' And as I thought this in my heart, a voice came to me, saying, 'O Basil! Basil! Why are you troubled in your heart over the pillars? The Lord, He Who took Habakkuk the prophet and placed him to the land of Babylon with food in his hands and he made him descend into the den with Daniel,[^1] He will move those pillars from their place.'

"When the sun arose, I had the people assemble and told them what I saw. Ira, the archpriest, responded to me, saying, 'O my father, we will do this task. I believe in the Lord, that He will make right our hearts with which we search. Take some parchment and inscribe upon it the image of the Holy Cross, then the Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ and the name of the Virgin Mary and the names of the seven archangels. Take a rod and hang upon it the Cross and we will go to the idolatrous temple. I know that Our Lord Jesus Christ will accomplish for us what we ask of Him.'

"I did as he said, taking a rod and placing it upon the pillars and they rolled before us until they arrived near the city. Then, we came upon sorcerers (whom we mentioned earlier) and, performing works of sorcery, they seized the pillars in the middle of the city. All the people cried out with one voice, saying, '*Kyrie eleison*!'[^2]

"When the sun set and it became night, we were exhausted from the many labours of the day and the people went to their homes in peace until the next day.

"Truly wondrous is the strength of your arms which defeated the sorcerers and carried the pillars."

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

[^1]: cf. Daniel 13:33-39
[^2]: 'Lord have mercy'
