A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

As is found in the *Synaxary* for the 8th of *Sane*:[^1] on this day is the commemoration of the consecration of the holy church of Our Lady, the holy Virgin Mary, which is known as Musturud, in the place where Our Lord Jesus Christ, with His mother Mary, caused to spring up a spring of blessed water during their return from the land of Egypt.

As an angel of the Lord had appeared to righteous Joseph in a dream, saying, "Rise and take the Child and his mother and go to the land of Egypt," he got up and took Our Lady Mary and Our Lord Christ and Salome, the daughter of the sister of the mother of Our Lady Mary. And they arrived in the land of Egypt, and went to Mount Qusqam and other places, remaining in the land of Egypt for three years and seven months.

When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph and ordered him to return to Jerusalem. Turning back, they arrived at the city of Muharraq and from there at the city of Cairo, and from there the city of Mataria, and from there the city of Musturud. And Our Lord Jesus Christ made to spring a spring of water while He was with His mother Mary and it remains there to this day.

And all the men of every city and every tribe came there and they made supplications in the name of Our Lady, the holy Virgin Mary, and they received blessings from her church and from the spring of blessed water.

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

>*Salutation, I say, to the consecration of thy temple, built*
>*Where thy son caused to spring up the water of blessing.*
>*Let a good gift and perfect portion*
>*Be given to those who pray at every hour*
>*In thy name, Mary, a name of benefit.*
