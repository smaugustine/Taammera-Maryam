A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

As is found in the *Synaxary* for the 16th of *Maskaram*:[^1] on this day

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

[^1]: September 20/1
