A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

Patriarch Theophilus said, "On Monday, at midnight, Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, came again and appeared to me as she promised me on the first night. She began speaking to me and said:

"'On the eighth day after this, they came in order to circumcise Him according to the law of the Jews. And they named Him Jesus according to what the angel said to me before I conceived Him.

"'And in those days, magicians came from an eastern land searching in the cities and villages, saying, “Where was Christ born? For we have seen His star in the east and we have come to worship Him.” And Herod heard this and was moved, together with all the people of the borders of Jerusalem. And he gathered together all the elders and priests and scribes and leaders and people and asked them and said, “From where is Christ to come? And when is His appointed time?” And they said to him, “In these days, in Bethlehem of Judah, just as the prophet Micah says, ‘And you, land of Ephratah, you are not the lowest of the regions of Judah. For from you a king will come who shall see My people Israel.’” And Herod said to the magicians, “Go and seek out the child. And when you find Him, come and tell me so that I may worship Him.” But he said this not because he was not going to worship Him but rather to kill him. He thought that He was earthly and His kingdom was earthly.

"'And when the magicians heard these things, they departed from the king to search for Him. And the star led them from their land until it brought them to the place where I was with my beloved son. And the star left them and retreated. And having entered, they saw the child in my arms and bowed to Him. And then they brought with joy and happiness gold, myrrh, and frankincense. And they cried out, saying, “Blessed is the Great King who will bring an end to the kingdoms of the earth. You descended to earth and bound Satan according to what we have found in the books of the prophets and the wise fathers.”

"'And when it became night, they slept, thinking that the next day they would go to Herod and tell him that they found the child and his mother. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them and told them, “Go back to your land in peace.” And they went back to their land as the angel of the Lord told them.

"'O Theophilus, keep and strengthen in your heard everything I tell you regarding the birth of my Son. ? . And having said this to me she hid herself."

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.
