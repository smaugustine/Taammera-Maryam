A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

Concerning how she revealed herself to Theophilus, the Patriarch of Alexandria, and how she spoke to him and strengthened him from the exhaustion of travel.

Patriarch Theophilus said, “Listen, my fathers and brothers, in fear and in righteous faith to what I shall tell you regarding how Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, appeared to me. On this past Sunday, after we had completed the evening prayer, my brothers, the bishops, went to sleep by themselves. I went up to the upper level, wherein resides Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, and I stood and stretched out my hands and prayed and pleaded with the Lord. And I said, ‘Hear me, My Lord and My Saviour, Jesus Christ, You who heard those assembled in Nicaea until they established the law of the Lord. Hear me, also, You who heard Abba Athanasius and aided him in his every tribulation. I am prepared for Your service. I know that You will hear me always and that You are near to all those who love Your Name. My Lord and my God, have mercy upon me and do not turn me away, I who have dedicated myself to You from my youth up to this day. I beseech You, that You show me Your arrival into this world and Your dwelling in this house in the desert, and help me to build this house so that it might become a great church where they will praise Your Holy Name and which will exalt and honour Your Name, You to whom is power and forgiveness. You are good, with Your Father and the Holy Spirit, now and always and forever and ever, amen.’

“And when I prayed thus, a great light appeared to me, and it seemed as if the sun had risen. And I saw a great and wondrous light upon which was sitting the Queen of Women, Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. Her face was shining like the sun and she was clothed with light, and there is no one on earth who is able to look upon such great glory. Michael and Gabriel and thousands of angels were circling her. When I saw them, I fell to the ground and was like a corpse. Michael lifted me up and took the fear and trembling away from me.

"Then she spoke to me herself and said to me, ‘I am the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the birth-giver of God. Arise and do not be afraid. Salutation to you, O horseman, warrior who fights for the sake of faith! Salutation to you, strong cornerstone of the churches of the Lord! Arise, be strong, and know that I am the mother of the King of Heaven and Earth! He whom the heavens and the earth cannot contain, I carried Him in my womb for nine months. I suckled with milk from my breasts He who feeds the whole world by His will. I am Mary, daughter of Joachim and Anna, of the tribe of Judah and the seed of David. I have appeared to you by the will of my beloved son and I will show you what you have sought and asked from me regarding this house and my coming to the land of Egypt from Jerusalem.

"'As for this house, He wishes to leave it as it is so that it will be a witness to all generations, those who are in the world, regarding the humility that came upon us. For my beloved son did not wish to be exalted on earth and ride upon the clouds, nor upon horses, which men ride upon, which is a boast of the earth. Rather, He was carried in my arms from Jerusalem to this house and we dwelt in it. In those days, I, in humility, remembered the words of Elizabeth, who said, “Who am I that you should come to me, the mother of my Lord?” And I said, “I thank You, My Lord Jesus Christ, You who blessed me beyond my station.”’

“And she responded to me and said to me, ‘O Theophilus, uncover the ear of your heart and understand what I shall tell you at this hour and write it upon parchment and bring it to all the cities and villages for my commemoration until the end of the world.

“‘When I gave birth to Jesus Christ, a star appeared in the east, and in the greatness of its light was hidden the lights of the other stars. And I was in my home and I was afraid of everything and there was no one who would serve me. For I was a virgin and I did not understand anything. I was the firstborn of my mother and I had never dwelt with any woman who had given birth except for barren Elizabeth. When she was close to giving birth, her neighbours prepared for her everything she needed. But I, I had no clothing, and I looked for some but did not find any except for patches of sackcloth. I wrapped His Holy Body up in those patches. And my pillow was a nearby manger where oxen were feeding and I laid the infant to sleep in it. And there was a donkey and an ox, and they bowed to Him and kept him warm with their breathing, since the days were cold.

"'And then, on the 29th of *Tāḫśāś*, I looked and immediately beheld angels and archangels, seraphim and cherubim, coming, each in their own kind, and they bowed and praised Him, each in His own tongue. And they said, "The Lord made this day and blessed it." And they came to me and they honoured me, for honour was given to me by the Father. And they said to me, "Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb, He who came to make His people good, those corrupted by sin. You are the immaculate bride and you are without guile. You are the honoured dove, the mother of the Lord, the queen, mother of the Living King who appeared from you and will become eternal Life. blessed are we who have seen the Lord born in the flesh."

"'And Gabriel approached me with a shining and joyous face. He bowed to me and said, "This is He whom I announced to you and brought glad tidings to you about earlier, that He would appear through you. And He will give mercy and strength to all people who believe in His Name and serve for His glory.

"'Then Joseph came and with him Salome, the midwife. And she rejoiced with great joy upon seeing the infant in the manger. And she bowed to Him and carried Him in her arms and said, "Blessed am I whose eyes have seen your joy today. You who have come into the world to forgive the wrongs of sinners, of which I am one." And she turned to me and said, "Blessed are you, Mother of God, whom the prophets cried out concerning, saying, 'Our Lord shall appear from a virgin.' And I, your handmaid, shall not be separated from you and I shall serve you until the day I die."

"'Then shepherds came to whom he had appeared in the light. And they bowed to Him in the manger, crying out and saying, "You are the Saviour of the World. Just as they told us, You are truly the Son of God. Blessed are we who have seen the glory of Your Divinity and who are worthy that we should be witnesses." And they approached me and bowed to me, saying, "Blessed are you among all women on earth. And blessed is your womb which bore Him and your breasts which nursed Him, for your son is for us eternal life." And they told me everything which had happened and the number of angels that they saw and heard saying, "Glory to God in the heavens and peace on earth, His favour to men." And everyone who heard was amazed, and I said, "What shall I become?"'

"After this, she said to me, 'O Theophilus, know and understand what I have told you. Tomorrow I shall come and tell you more.' Then she hid herself from me."

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.
