A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

??

Then we arrived at the city of Hermopolis, at the first gate of the tower with four corners which rises above the city. The city fell and was destroyed because they worshiped idols there. The Lord Jesus said to it, "Be a sign to this city and to men unto the ages." It was as He said and the city is known as a ruin to this day.

There was a tree in that place that bowed beneath the feet of my beloved son. It said, "How joyous is Your coming, Lord Jesus, Son of God." And the Lord spoke to it and said, “Worms shall never enter you. Be a witness of my entrance into this city today.” All the people, great and small, were amazed at the glory which was upon my son. They said, “We have never seen one like this child.”

While we were walking through the square of the city, five camels blocked us on the road. When my son saw them, he said to them, “Stand,” and they became like stones, even to this day.

There was a man whose name was Tǝflǝm and the mercy of the Lord was upon him. He received us and let us dwell in his house. All the idols that were in the city fell and were broken. And all the priests of the gods were afraid and hid inside their homes.

When morning came, all the people gathered where we were, those who were sick, mute, and deaf, and each afflicted with their own disease. And my son placed his hand upon them and healed them of all their illnesses.

And many miracles took place in that city. And if I were to tell you all of them, there would be more than parchment can contain. And many people came to us and oppressed us due to the many miracles that day.

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.
