A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

Patriarch Theophilus said, "On Tuesday Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, appeared to me and began to tell me about her son. She said to me, 'O Theophilus, listen as I tell you ??

"'And when forty days had passed, we brought Him up to the temple that they might do to him the law of Moses, just as they do to the children of Israel. And when we brought him to the altar, there was a priest whose name was Simeon. He was waiting to see the saviour before he died. And I handed him over to him, and he received him and carried him in his arms and blessed him and went around the altar. And when my beloved son saw Simeon, his eyes were opened, for he was blind. And he opened his mouth and immediately said, “Now dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord, as You have commanded. For my eyes have seen Your salvation which you prepared before all your people in order to reveal a light to the gentiles and to be the honour of your people Israel.” And having completed this, he gave me the child and we left in peace with joy and happiness. And that day Simeon, the elderly priest, died.

"'And Herod waited two years waiting for the magicians to come to him, but they did not return, since they had departed to their dwelling. And Herod was agitated and afraid in everything (he) did. And Satan appeared to him at night in the form of a learned man and said to him, “Why do you remain now? You and all your kingdom will be destroyed.” And Herod replied, saying, “What should I do?” And Satan said to him, “Tomorrow, in the morning, send your servants and order them not to skip any child two years old and under and to kill them, as that child will be found among those killed, so that he will not grow up and take your kingdom.” And that night an angel appeared to Joseph and said to him, “Get up and take the child and his mother and flee to the land of Egypt until I tell you, for Herod is searching in order to kill the child.” And immediately we got up and we went to the land of Egypt, and Salome was with us also.

"'And when morning came, Herod ordered them to kill all the infants in Bethlehem and all its villages and borders as he had been informed by the magicians and as Satan, the father of all anger, told him. And we got up and Joseph was before me. And I carried my son, sometimes on my shoulders, sometimes on my side, sometimes in my hands, and Salome took turns with me, due to the distance of the journey and from the exhaustion of travel. (Sometimes,) I set Him down so that He would follow me, as women do to teach their children to walk, for I was a small woman and I was not accustomed to hardship. And He would walk little by little, and he would hold on to the edge of my clothes. And He looked like all children who cry to their mothers to carry them. And immediately I would carry him on my side and embrace him and take joy in His walking, while condemning Herod and cursing him and all his kingdom because he brought harm upon the infants who were without sin because he killed them and caused sadness in the chests of their fathers and mothers. And Joseph, carrying our provisions, when he saw Salome carrying the child, took the child upon his shoulders.

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.
