A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

John, Son of Thunder, said, "I looked and there appeared a great sign in heaven: a woman who was clothed with the sun and the moon below her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars."[^1] This is the John whom Our Lord Jesus saw with Mary while He was on the wood of the Holy Cross. He said to His mother, "Behold, your son." And He said to his disciple whom he loved, "Behold, your mother." He called him a son of His mother, even though he was a disciple, since He loved him greatly. And the apostles, too, in their Synodicon, honoured him, saying, "For he spoke divinely," and they ordered that his gospel be enthroned upon the altar. This is the John who saw the adornment of the miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, who was veiled with the sun, the moon under her feet, and stars for the crown of her head.

But the sun with which Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, is dressed is not like the sun of this world, from which we hide by going into caves and palaces, into shelters, camps, and tents. Rather, the sun with which she is clothed is Our Lord Jesus Christ, Who sits upon the cherubim and seraphim and peers into the depths.

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

>*When the beast, plotting to devour thy child, pursued thee,*
>*In*
>*a*
>*The Woman of Heaven, Mary, thou who wast clothed with the sun,*
>*John wrote about thy sign which he saw.*
