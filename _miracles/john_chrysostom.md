A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

There was a certain man, an archbishop of the city of Constantinople, named John Chrysostom.[^1] It happened that, before he received his ordination to the priesthood and to the archepiscopacy, that Peter gave to him keys and John gave him the Gospel. They said to him, "Do not be afraid. ???. For we were sent to you by our Great Teacher, Jesus Christ. I am Peter, to whom he gave the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven.[^2] Behold, I give to you the keys of the Church, which is unto the ends of the earth." And the other said to him, "I am the John who ? ? . I said, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.[^3] And He is like a sword of fire against the enemy.[^4]' Behold, I give this to you from Our Lord Jesus Christ." ??

Behold, Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, appeared to him dressed in clothes that were white as snow and she comforted him and strengthened him

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

[^1]: 'golden-mouthed'
[^2]: cf. Matthew 16:19
[^3]: John 1:1
[^4]: perhaps a paraphrase of John 1:5; recall that the Holy Spirit is called "Melos, the terrifying sword of fire"
