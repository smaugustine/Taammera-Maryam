A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

It is said that there was, in the church of the city of Toledo, a bishop whose name was Dexius, a blessed and good man who loved Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, with all his heart and served her with all his strength.

Out of the flame of his love for her, he collected her miracles and praises into a book for the sake of her honour. When he completed the book of her miracles, Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, appeared to him and, picking up the book with her hands, said to him, "My beloved Dexius, I am pleased with you. I praise you for making this book for me." Then, she hid herself from him.

When the bishop saw this vision out of the love of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, he rejoiced greatly and burned like a fire with love for her. He thought about what he could do to increase and multiply her honour. So, he initiated a feast in honour of her annunciation from Gabriel, as no one had celebrated it previously on account of the Lenten fast. He set it eight days before the feast of the Nativity and ordained it during the days of his episcopacy, lasting until this day. When the people celebrated the feast, they rejoiced greatly.

And Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, appeared to him, holding in her hands a beautiful vestment, and said to him, "O my beloved servant Dexius, I praise you and rejoice in you. I take pleasure in your work. Just as you rejoiced in me and created a feast for the annunciation of Gabriel — the angel who brought me glad tidings — and have brought joy to all people for my sake, I want to reward and honour you in this world before all men, just as you honoured me. Behold, I give you this vestment to wear. May it be for you alone. o one can wear it except for you and no one can sit upon your thone after you. I shall take vengeance upon whoever disregards what I have said to you." Having said this, she hid herself from him.

When the days of his life were completed, he journeyed from this world to the mercy of the Lord Most High and they kept the vestment in the church in great honour and purity.

Then, another bishop was appointed after him, and he wanted to put on the vestment and sit upon Dexius' throne. The priests and elders of the church warned him, saying, "Do not do this!" But he replied, "Am I not a man as he was? Am I not a bishop as he was? I want to wear this vestment and sit upon his throne." And they could not dissuade him.

When he put on the vestment and sat upon the throne, immediately he fell from the throne in front of all the people who were in the church and he died an evil and exceedingly abominable death. All the people in the church were amazed at this miracle which happened and they gave glory to the laudable and Most High Lord and praised Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, because she performed this miracle. They feared her and increased their service to and honouring of her.

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.
