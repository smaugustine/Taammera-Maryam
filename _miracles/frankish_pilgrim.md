A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

There was a certain pilgrim from the land of Francia who was very wealthy in gold and silver and fine clothes. When he heard the story of a certain icon of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the birth-giver of God, he became exceedingly glad and abandoned his journey and all his possessions and went to the city of Saidnaya. He arrived there in the guise of a poor servant, doing this so that he might steal the icon and take it back to his own country, Francia. And he stayed there, serving her church in the city of Saidnaya.

And two years passed as he waited to find the shutter of the window open so that he might take the icon and flee to his own land, but the abbess guarded the shutter of the window every day. Since it was not possible for him to take the icon, he took a knife, put his hand through the latticework, and cut off a piece of the body from the icon. Suddenly, a great quantity of blood flowed from it. Having taken the piece of the body, he left, fleeing.

And when the people learned that he had hidden himself, they searched for him and, when they found him, seized him and wanted to kill him. But a voice came out of the icon of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the birth-giver of God, which said, “Leave him be and do not kill him, for he did not do this wickedly but, on account of my love, he took it so that it might be for him a blessing.”

So they only took from him the piece which he had cut from the body of the icon and did as she had ordered them. And they returned this piece of the body to its proper place, and it became one with the rest of the icon and the icon became as it was before, except for a trace of the knife and the blood, which remains even to this day.

And they praised the Lord, praiseworthy and glorified, and they praised Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the birth-giver of God, full of mercy.

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.
