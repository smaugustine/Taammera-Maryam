A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

A miracle which she performed ... Abba Paese and his sister Thecla[^1] in the city of Alexandria.

There was a certain man whose name was Abba Paese who had a sister named Thecla. They were of the city of Abusir, in environs of Hermopolis. Abba Paese had a dear friend in Alexandria named Paul the Syrian, a blessed and good man. While he was in the city of Alexandria, he suffered great pains until death came for him. He wrote to his dear friend Abba Paese, saying, "O my brother, come quickly that I might see you before I die." So Abba Paese arose and went quickly to Alexandria and came to his dear fiend Paul. While he was there, Abba Paese was called to the task of martyrdom and endured many tortures for the sake of the Name of Christ.

Since he was there for a long time, his sister Thecla left Abusir for Alexandria to learn what had happened to her brother. So she went to the shore of the sea, to the city of Antinoopolis, and found a spiritual ship waiting outside the city. On the ship was Gabriel, the angel of glad tidings, and Suriel, the angel, was standing upon it and Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, was seated upon it and Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, was seated beside her.

Thecla approached the angels, whom she thought were the masters of the ship, and said to them, "To which city are you going, O blessed ones?" And they said to her, "Our intention, if it is the will of the Lord, is to go to the city of Alexandria." And she said to them, "Bring me upon this ship to Alexandria and I will give you whatever payment you ask." And they said to her, "Quickly, now, bring your possessions! We wish to sail upon this northern wind and it is favourable for our course at this time. We do not need payment from you, but we have a small request. There are with us some honoured wives of senior men. As we have received payment from them, we will receive payment from you."

Then Thecla went quickly and brought her possessions to the ship and took with her a little gold for the journey and for alms for the poor. She also took the keys of her house and gave them to her son, Apollonius. Having done this, she brought with her one of her handmaidens. When Thecla arrived at the ship, the angels, having taken the appearance of sailors, welcomed her and brought her onto the ship and sat her next to the blessed women. Then they untied the ship and set sail immediately, since the wind was favourable to them, according to the will of the Lord.

Thecla said to the women, "Salutation to you, O holy and blessed ones!" And they said to her, "Salutation to you, O blessed sister! It is good that a sister should join us!" And they rejoiced with her exceedingly. Thecla said to the angels, "Take some of these provisions we have and eat." And they said to her, "It is not customary for us to

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.
