A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

There was a certain man in a certain city, a poor stonecutter named Eulogius. He frequently welcomed foreigners with his meagre wealth. When he completed his work, he received the wages for his labour in gold each day from those whom he worked for and then picked up a lamp with his hand and went around the streets of the city looking for all the foreigners he could find. He would kiss their feet, crying bitterly, then bring them water and wash their feet. He would then bring them to his table so that they might eat until they were satisfied. If one of them remained, he would drive away the dogs since he did not lodge the following day ?bread in his house?. He continued doing this for 100 years.

There was a certain monk whose name was Daniel who lived, ? watching him, for 48 years.

And when he went, he sold the work of his hands in the city where Eulogius was.

And when it was evening, he returned to his house with joy and Abba Daniel having seen him, was amazed (at how) Eulogius loved strangers.

And Abba Daniel told everyone (about) the goodness of Eulogius, saying, “When I returned to my land, I remembered the goodness of that man.

“And I laboured many days because of him so that the Lord would give him blessings and the service of strangers.

“And after I had laboured for one week, I fell down and slept due to the great labour.

“And behold, a shining man appeared to me and said to me, ‘What are you (doing), Daniel?’

“And I said to him, ‘O lord, I am making a covenant with the Lord that I will not eat or drink for the sake of Eulogius the stonecutter so that He will give him blessings and the service of strangers.’

“And the shining man said to me, ‘I do not ask for this, his good work is sufficient.’ 

“And I said to him, ‘He has nothing. O lord, give to him that he may do good for strangers and everyone who sees (him) will praise the Lord.’

“And he said to me, ‘Since he lives in a good (manner) and you desire many things, will you be responsible?’

“And I said to him, ‘I will be responsible for him, O lord, for I desire the salvation of his soul.’ And I said this in a dream and saw that we were (in) Jerusalem.

“And behold, a shining infant said to me, ‘Is this not enough for Eulogius? Take care for yourself, for I will demand from you.’

“And, speaking to me, ‘Behold, two men have brought many goods and put on the clothes of Eulogius’

“And immediately I awoke and understood that the Lord had accepted my prayer and I gave thanks to the Lord.’”

And Eulogius got up in the morning where he worked, and as he was cutting stone, he found a jar which was full of gold.

And he was terrified and sad, “These goods belong to the Muslims and when I return to my house the judge will take me.

“Unless I go to a land where they do not know me.” And, having taken the gold, he embarked on a ship and travelled to Rome and went to Constantinople and forgot his offerings entirely.

And he went to Vespasian, the emperor, and gave him the goods and the emperor appointed him as a governor over the whole city and he acquired many goods and chariots.

And his heart became arrogant and without mercy after many years. And I saw in my dream that I was (in) Jerusalem and I saw that shining infant.

And I thought about Eulogius. And I saw as he gave glory towards that infant and praise towards the judges.

And immediately I awoke and, rising in the morning, I went to that city, saying, “Woe is me! I am exhausted. For I myself perished.” And then I sold the work of my hands. And I remained until it became evening watched for him.

And (I) beheld a Hebrew woman and said to her, “Give me bread, for [fol.] I have nothing to dine on.”

And she said to me, “Behold, young man, it is not proper for you to remain in the cities. Is it not better for a monk to labour?”

And I said to her, “Forgive me, for I have come to obtain my possessions.”

And she said to me, “Why have you left your monastery?”

And I said to her, “Is there not a man here who receives strangers and takes care of them?”

And she said to me, “Yes, he is here. And he has done many things for strangers and for the hungry.”

And the Lord saw his good deeds and gave him grace and he was appointed.

Having heard this, I said in my heart, “I myself have acquired sin by myself. And I embarked on a ship and went to Constantinople and inquired about him.”

And they told me his location and I remained at the gate so that when he went out I would see him.

And when he went out, I saw him in great glory and power and I said to him, “May your mercy come upon me.”

And I wanted to tell him something, but he did not turn his face toward me. And I called to his retainers who were running around him.

And my heart was injured because of him and I went to the church and prostrated before the icon of Our Lady Mary. I cried and said, “O my Lady Mary, Birth-giver of God, keep back this man’s debt from me so that I will not perish on account of him.

And having said this, I slept with pain in my heart. And behold, I heard many men saying, “Behold! the queen comes. Thousands upon thousands and tens of thousands upon tens of thousands are coming around her.

And I called out and said, “O my lady, queen, may your mercy come upon me.”

And she said to me, “What have you done?”

And I said to her, “I was made responsible for Eulogius the governor. Order him to come and release me from my debt.”

And she said to me, “I cannot order him to come. Go and control your debt.” And immediately I awoke and I said in my heart, “I will not leave the gate until I have spoken to him unless I die.”

And I saw where the gate was and when he went out I called and the doorkeeper beat me and crushed my entire body to the point of death. And I said, “Let me return, then, to my land.”

Even though I wished for the Lord to save me with Eulogius, I embarked on a ship and arrived in Alexandria, (in) the land of Egypt.

And I returned to my dwelling and slept, having grown sad. And I saw in my dream that I was in Jerusalem.

And I saw that shining infant sitting in a holy place.

And he looked at me in anger and I trembled at his terror like a leaf which the wind moves and I could not open my mouth.

And he said to me, “Did you not go? You will repay the debt which is upon you. And he ordered those standing to hang me and they hung me up.

And then they said to me, “Take care and do not do the task which is beyond your ability and you will not be a debater with words.

And as I was hung, behold, the queen arrived and when I saw her I was comforted. And I said to her, “Have mercy on me, O My Lady.” And she said to me, “What do you want?”

And I said to her, “I have been hung because of the debt of Eulogius.” And she said to me, “I will intercede for you.” And she kissed the feet of that infant.

And then he said to me, “Be careful of this again. You did not act this way, what is bad did not find you.”

And I said to him, “I have sinned. O Lord, forgive me, your servant.”

And immediately he brought me up and said to me, “Go, Daniel.” And behold, he returned (me?) where (I was?) before.

And I awoke and praised the Lord for he delivered me from responsibility for Eulogius.

And after three months, I heard him say to me that Vespasian the emperor had died and they appointed another emperor in his place.

And he brought accusations against three great men, according to their names, Decrades, Sisaius, and Eulogius. And the emperor ordered them to plunder their possessions and to cut off their heads with a sword.

And having heard (this), Eulogius abandoned everything and fled in the night from Constantinople and arrived in the land of Egypt.

And a servant of the emperor killed him in (the place where) he found him. And the men of his city said to him, “We have heard that you were appointed in the land of Rome.”

And he said to them, “It is not (true), for I remained in my work and went to a monastery and I prayed. It is another Eulogius and not I.

And he called his attendant and he dressed in goatskin as the first and he said in his heart, “O wretched one. You were not looking for appointment so that they would cut your head off.”

And he took ? of stone and he went to where he was before and looked where he found the goods and the one who killed was honoured (?)

And he said, “I will do my job and I feed the poor.” And he was willing in his spirit through the prayer of Our Lady Mary, Birth-giver of God.

For there is nothing for the Lord he satisfied him and he did not forget the labour which he did before.

And then they saw, o beloved Christians, her mercy and her abundant love of men. For she does not overlook all who supplicate her regarding any distress which arises.

And they say how she delivered Eulogius from the judge of this world, the destroyer, and she returned him to where he was before.

In order that he receive the traveller in the possessions of his poverty from the toil of his hands through working stone what he obtained every day.

Because of the prayer of Abba Daniel, 

EMDA 10, ff. 208v-

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.
