A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

There was a certain bishop named Cyriacus who lived in the city of Oxyrhynchus. He loved Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, with all his heart and all his mind. This bishop was a righteous and good man. It happened that he was sad and wept because he did not have much education. He always had a good wish: that he might be like Ephrem the Syrian, who composed praises for Our Lady Mary. He said, "If the praises of Mary will increase in me like the sands of the sea and the stars of the sky, then I shall wear it like a cloak and taste it? as I said." But the monks of the monastery slandered him and mocked him and spurned him and ridiculed him because he did not have much education, but he endured their derision.

One day, during the days on which there is a feast of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, namely, that which takes place on the 1st of Gǝnbot.[^1] The priests and monks were amazed at him and said, "Serve the Divine Liturgy for us and give the people the Holy Mysteries. Abba Cyriacus replied, saying, "How can it be possible for me to serve the Divine Liturgy here in the midst of the congregation? I do not have much education and this day is an especially great day. How can it be possible for me, considering all these things?" Then they said to him, "If you refuse us, we will speak to the Patriarch and he will find out what you have done to the people And they will bring another to replace you. You will be infamous because of your refusal to make the offering and you will be ashamed before all the people gathered here and in every place. He will accuse you before the people and annul your ordination." Immediately he said to them, "All right. Be patient with me a little." And he withdrew from them a little.

Then, Abba Cyriacus said privately, "O My Lady, holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, see the wickedness of those monks, for they see my weakness and neglect me and seize me in the assembly of their wickedness. 

When he completed his prayer, he returned to them then vested and prepared for the Liturgy of the Catechumens, for the serving of the Mysteries, and for the elevation of the Eucharist with his holy hands. And the monks assisted him, as was customary. He began, saying:

  *Blessed is the Lord, the Father Almighty, Our God.*

  *And blessed is His Only Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, Who was born from Mary, the holy Virgin, for our salvation.*

  *And blessed is the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, the Strengthener and the Purifyer of us all.*[^2]

And after this, they read the epistle of Paul, the catholic epistle, and the Acts of the Apostles. After that, Abba Cyriacus read from the Gospel of John, where it is written concerning the Bread of Life which came down from heaven and which is the Body and Blood of Christ.[^3]

When he came to the middle of the Divine Liturgy, ???? because he did not know any anaphora except the Anaphora of the Apostles.

and he began to say with a loud voice,

  *My heart overflows with a good word!*

  *My heart overflows with a good word!*

  *My heart overflows with a good word!*

  *And I proclaim the Anaphora of Mary!*

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.
