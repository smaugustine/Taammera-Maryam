A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

There was a certain man, a monk of Dabra Ṭimonā, whose name was Ephrem. He was a fisherman for the monks of the monastery. Every year he commemorated the feast of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, on which she received the Covenant of Mercy from her son. On the day of her feast, he would give fish to all the men of the monastery.

One day, he called the monks of the monastery so that he could catch some fish, and 270 men followed him in order to carry the fish. Arriving at the edge of the sea, he stood and cast his net over the sea and, dragging the net, took the fish out. Suddenly, a serpent devoured him and the monks fled and told the abbot.
	
The abbot ordered that they should sound the semantron. The monks gathered and he announced to them that a serpent had devoured Ephrem. Immediately, they went into the church and stood before the icon of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, and supplicated to her, saying prayers so that she might release Ephrem from the death of the marsh. And she appeared to the abbot that night in a dream, showing him the place where the serpent would rest at the edge of the sea. And the abbot took the monks to the place where Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, appeared to him. And the serpent came out and approached them, wishing to devour them, and the monks cried out to Our Lady Mary, the Birth-giver of God, and prayed the *Salutation of the Angel*.[^1] And she received their prayer and commanded the beast and made it spit him up.

Ten days and ten nights after the serpent had devoured him, Ephrem came out of the belly of the beast alive, having not been harmed him at all. They washed him of the foul odour, perfumed him, and led him to a feast. And they praised Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, and, until the day of their deaths, they increased their celebration of her feast and their honouring of the name of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God.
  
May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.

[^1]: i.e., the prayer which begins, "In the salutation of St. Gabriel the angel, O Our Lady Mary, salutation to you..." (በሰላመ፡ ቅዱስ፡ ገብርኤል፡ መልአክ፡ ኦእግዝእትነ፡ ማርያም፡ ሰላም፡ ለኪ፨)
